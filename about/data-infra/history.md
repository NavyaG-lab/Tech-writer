# History

## `cantareira`

On April 12 2016 at 06:11 pm (local time),
[Konrad Scorciapino asked](https://nubank.slack.com/archives/C0XRWDYQ2/p1460495488000041):
> enquete: novo nome pro [environment] exploration

The suggestions that appeared were (in this order):
> analysis, data, olap, inquiry, reconnaissance, learning, study, research, exploring, investigation,
nevermind, datalake, dadoslago, detamizumi, inspection, deitaleique, mindfulenv, dedomenalakkos,
envshippador, seriousbusiness, navegantes, cabral, titicaca, envy, lagoazul, shippito, mothership,
sheepard, dataaccess, datathing, datass, tupi-fagulha, escolinha, datahive, databag, datatubes,
cantareira, trampolim, picnic

After 30 min of deliberation on Slack, `cantareira` was the clear winner. At the time
[Sistema Cantareira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_Cantareira) was frequently on the news
because of a water crisis.

## `sao_pedro`

On April 19 2016 at 06:51 pm (local time),
[André Midea announced](https://nubank.slack.com/archives/C0XRWDYQ2/p1461102662000037):
> Nosso scheduler vai se chamar Sáo Pedro
>
> objecoes? rs

Nobody argued against it.

The name was chosen because São Pedro is the one who makes it rain in the `cantareira`.

## `capivara`

On June 29 2016 at 06:57 pm (local time),
[Alessandro Andrioni posted an image](https://nubank.slack.com/archives/C0XRWDYQ2/p1467237428000600)
with a capybara from the website of the city of Curitiba. Although the
[law 13544/10 of Curitiba](https://cm-curitiba.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/849380/lei-13544-10)
declares that "grimpeiro" is the "ave-símbolo" of the city, the capybara can be considered also the
[city mascot](http://livre.jor.br/mascote-oficial-de-curitiba-e-o-passaro-grimpeiro-pia-capivara/).

## `sabesp`

The [first commit](https://github.com/nubank/sabesp/commit/f6c624bab552a326a5606d501a7f4f3b77743982)
was on August 15 2016 at 07:29 pm (local time). The first record of "sabesp" on Slack was
[on August 18 2016 at 03:37 pm (local time)](https://nubank.slack.com/archives/C1SNEPL5P/p1471545476000450).

## `itaipu`

The [first commit](https://github.com/nubank/itaipu/commit/d8e1da5ab61cced72a28ccce73cb3af151aad83e)
was on November 23 2016 at 03:48 pm (local time). On December 01 2016 at 11:00 am,
[Pepijn Looije asked how to move code into the itaipu monorepo](https://nubank.slack.com/archives/C1SNEPL5P/p1480597223000876).
On [December 05 2016](https://nubank.slack.com/archives/C0XRWDYQ2/p1480970924000169), itaipu was
considered the "new" ETL, and capivara the "old" ETL.

## `tapir`

On [July 03 2017 at 06:54 pm (local time)](https://nubank.slack.com/archives/G5VAVUC6L/p1499118856144235),
André Midea posted on a private channel on Slack an
[image of a capybara with a tapir](https://78.media.tumblr.com/75b51867fb65b116b25cfabcadbe86af/tumblr_inline_p2kmdyTvz41rvkz2p_400.png)
(from
[this page](http://brazilspill.tumblr.com/post/169713316652/capybaras-being-friends-with-literally-any-other))
and wrote that tapir was "o par perfeito para o capivara".
