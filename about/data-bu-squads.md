# About Data BU squads

The following are the squads that contribute and use the information on the data-platform docs.

### Data Infra

The Data Infrastructure (Data Infra) Squad, part of Data BU, is responsible for extracting the data from the production databases and data from other sources such as click-streams, third-parties, etc. It then transforms and processes the data to make it available for the analytical environment. The team provides data that helps to remove uncertainty in the business and provide insights that help in decision making and achieve improved products and services.

For information on Data Infra Slack channels and services owned, see [Data BU Honey group](https://honey.is/home/#group/162759).

### Data Access

The Data Access Squad, part of Data BU, processes queries and enables users to connect to the semantic model (as a dataset) and create rich visualizations. The data is accessible to quickly analyze and build Reports or Dashboards and provide helpful insights into the business conditions and customer engagement. Data Access provides a set of tools that enables Nubankers to extract value from data.

### Data Users

Data Platform Docs acts as a reference documentation hub for Data users. It helps Data users in

* understanding our infrastructure during onboarding
* implementing a new kind of data processing flow for the first time
* allowing Data users to share instructions which could add value to other Data users
* understanding a part of our infrastructure they are not too familiar with
* during debugging

Most users contribute to the Data Platform docs when they have built something they feel would benefit all data users. Some users provide small corrections or updates after they have struggled with some functionality or flow and got the aid from Data Infra or Data Access engineers.
