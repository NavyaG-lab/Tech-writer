# Data Access' Rotations

## Rationale behind the rotations

With the intent of maintaining good stability of our data tools and giving our users proper support, we implemented some rotations on the Data Access team. These rotations should allow us to achieve the forementioned goals and at the same time minimize interruptions and burden to the engineers involved.

## Documentations about the rotations

All the documentation about our rotations can be found as follows:

* [On-call engineer](on-call-engineer.md)
* [Data Support](data-support.md)
* [Itaipu PR Reviewer](itaipu-pr-reviewer.md)

## General policies

### About conflicts between rotations

Some conflicts between rotations might happen (i.e. one person active at more than one rotation at the same time), and here are some policies that help coping with them:

* **On-call Engineer + Itaipu PR Reviewer:** in this case the indication is to override the Itaipu PR Reviewer rotation and swap with somebody else (maybe the next week's on-call engineer, for instance)
* **On-call Engineer + Data Support:** if there is not much on-call workload on this specific day, try to work on both roles. Otherwise, try to use support first from the Level 2 On-call Engineer or from the whole Data Access squad if the on-call activities are taking most of your time
* **Itaipu PR Reviewer + Data Support:** no actions here; try to work in both roles and count on the Data Access squad support if the workload is too heavy
