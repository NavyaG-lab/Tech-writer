# Working group output index

Working groups are mini taskforces aimed at solving non-tech related problems of the squad. They are composed of volunteers, mandated by the broader team to research, discuss and decide on solutions to these problems.

This document tracks working groups and their major decisions, linking to the actual artifacts produced in the process.

It is the responsability of the working group lead to update this document (if applicable) before handing over or closing the working group. Please follow the [instructions on how to maintain the information organised](working_group_output_organisation.md) when updating this document.
