# Working Group output organisation

* All documents should live under the [Working Group folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r7gBoCtaM2-Qqmc_bhnRCKIMTrb0vWVb) in the squad drive
* Working group outputs are grouped by year
* Please follow naming convention of working group root folders: `yyyy-mm – <working group name>`
* You're free to organise the data as you wish within the folder. If there is a chronological order, you can think about dating the file names or numbering them so that this order is more apparent.
* When updating the [index](index.md), please link your working group name to its root folder, and any major decision to the document where it was made
