# On-Call Playbook

This document is a resource for engineers *on-call*.  The general layout of
this document is Alert: Reasoning: Action(s).  All the alert entries here
should be linked with the alerts being sent to our alerting platform.

## [Alert]
* put the reasoning behind the alert here to provide context

What should be done to most directly resolve the alert.  What things
we need to look for.  What procedures to follow.  What commands to
