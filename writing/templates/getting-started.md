# Getting Started

A getting started guide is a quick reference user's guide that introduces the basics of a product, including the purpose
and business value of the product, key product terms and acronyms, information to help users get started using the
product, common work processes, and ways to connect to help, support, and training.

## What the guide is and isn't

A getting started guide should be engaging and welcoming to a new user. The guide should be

* **Visual** - Show the product, work process, and concepts associated with the software. Make the guide visually appealing and interactive.
* **Basic** - Focus on the fundamentals of the product. This guide is probably the first thing a user will encounter with the documentation.
* **Easy to read** - Use an engaging and conversational tone. Users should be able to easily skim the guide.

The guide should not be

* **Too technical** - Focus on the basics of the product. Avoid jargon as well as complex work processes and procedures.
* **A huge wall of text** - Break up the text into easy to read pieces with subheadings, lists, tables, conceptual graphics, and so on. The guide needs to be easy to digest and easy to skim. A huge amount of text is overwhelming to a new user.
* **The documentation, restated** - Use examples or scenarios to help introduce a topic. The guide should focus on introductory material for a product. It is not a place for procedures found in other guides.

### Tone

The guide should use a natural, conversational tone. Achieving a natural, conversational tone can be difficult. Here
are some tips:

* Read your content out loud to yourself to make sure your content sounds conversational. If it takes more than one
  breath to read a sentence, it is too long. Edit and simplify.
* Get someone who is not associated with your product to review your work. If they need help understanding terms or concepts, it is too technical. Edit and rewrite to make it easier to understand.

### Format

Use screenshots, conceptual graphics, lists, tables, and subheadings to make the guide friendly and engaging.

### Content

The guide assumes that the prerequisites are installed and configured, and its content focuses on the first things a user would do to start using the product - What do you need to know about it? What are the first things you need to do to start doing your work?
