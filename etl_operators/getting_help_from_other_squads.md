# Getting help from a different squad

If during a crash you find yourself needing urgent help from another squad, you should first go to that squad's channel(s) and see if you can find somewhere who can help you there. If no one is available to help (because the crash is outside work hours for example), most horizontal squads can be alerted via a special email address which links to their respective OpsGenie. Simply send an email to that address describing the problem and letting them know to come to #data-crash, and someone will show up to help you.
