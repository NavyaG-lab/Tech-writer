[fn:1] It doesn't support nested schemas
[fn:2] Through notebooks
[fn:3] Can be any Hive-registered table
[fn:4] Hot new thing
[fn:5] AWS isn't adding great features to the Redshift core--just bandaid like
Athena
[fn:6] Google is pushing hard on its Google Cloud Platform
[fn:7] Spark is an active open-source project
[fn:8] Parquet is in beta
[fn:9] Requires a system that generates manifest files to S3 and manage the
connection pooling
[fn:10] Currently requires a transfer of data from AWS to GCP, after that
requires some lambda style function that triggers load into BigQuery
[fn:11] Just needs to register a Hive table for it to be available for queries
