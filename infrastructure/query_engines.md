1. Through notebooks
2. It doesn't support nested schemas [https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/5808]
3. Databricks has their own web based notebook implementation that runs Scala,
Python, R, and SQL that you are supposed to use if you want to benefit from auto
scaling clusters
4. Parquet is in beta
5. Can be any Hive-registered table
6. Google BigQuery has a lot of functions for arrays:
[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/arrays]
7. Spark has sufficient support to create and unnest collections, but is
probably more verbose than BigQuery
8. Smaller overhead than reading from block storage like S3 because data is
stored on disk:
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_redshift_system_overview.html]
9. Smaller overhead than reading from block storage like S3 because of
BigQuery's distributed filesystem Colossus:
[https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/04/inside-capacitor-bigquerys-next-generation-columnar-storage-format]
10. Databricks queries files that are on block storage like S3, so IO
performance is worse than disk storage like Redshift and BigQuery
11. Databricks is improving its IO caching and its configurable:
[https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/databricks-io-cache.html]
12. Hot new thing
13. AWS isn't adding great features to the Redshift core--just bandaid like
Spectrum
14. Google is pushing hard on its Google Cloud Platform
15. Spark is an active open-source project
16. Requires a system that generates manifest files to S3 and manage the
connection pooling
17. Currently requires a transfer of data from AWS to GCP, after that requires
some lambda style function that triggers load into BigQuery
18. Just needs to register a Hive table for it to be available for queries
19. Redshift cancels a bad query if the bad query is using all the disk space
20. Snowflake drive for Metabase PR: [https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/6658]
21. Looker and Snowflake integration: [https://looker.com/solutions/snowflake]
22. Snowflake supported SQL Editing / Querying Tools: [https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/ecosystem-editors.html]
23. Snowflake Data Loading: [https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/data-load.html]
